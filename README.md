# Interactive System Maintenance Script

This script allows you to perform system maintenance tasks interactively, step by step. Each step requires your confirmation before execution. You can choose to learn what each step does or execute it directly. The colored output makes the results of each operation clear and easy to understand.

## Features

- **Interactive Confirmation:** Each command block requires confirmation from the user (by pressing [y] or Enter) before execution, or it can be skipped with [n].
- **Explanation Option:** Press [e] to view an explanation of what the command block does.
- **Colored Output:** The commands and their results are displayed in colors; successful operations in green and errors in red.
- **Modular Structure:** Each step is presented as an independent block, allowing you to choose and run only the steps you want.
- **System Update and Repair:** Updates package lists, upgrades outdated packages, repairs broken dependencies, and completes unfinished configurations.
- **Firmware & Nvidia Update:** Updates Linux firmware and Nvidia drivers.
- **Snap Package Management:** Lists, removes snap packages, and cleans snapd from your system.
- **Flatpak Installation:** Installs Flatpak as an alternative package manager and adds the Flathub repository.
- **GNOME Desktop Installation:** Installs the Ubuntu GNOME desktop environment along with related packages.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu or a Debian-based Linux distribution.
- A `bash` terminal environment.
- `sudo` privileges for certain operations.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-system-maintenance.git
   cd interactive-system-maintenance
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x interactive_script.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   ./interactive_script.sh
   ```

   For each step, you will be presented with the following options:
   - **[y] or Enter:** Execute the command block.
   - **[n]:** Skip the command block.
   - **[e]:** Display an explanation of the command block, then ask if you wish to run it.

## Script Structure

The script uses the `run_block` function to manage each step's description, commands, and results. Each block works as follows:
- **Title & Description:** Provides the name of the block and a summary of its function.
- **Commands:** Lists the commands to be executed one by one.
- **Operation Result:** After each command execution, a success or error message is shown in colored text.

## Important Notes

- **System Configuration:** Some steps (e.g., disabling AppArmor or removing snap packages) can make permanent changes to your system. It is recommended to create a backup before running the script.
- **Nvidia Drivers:** Replace `nvidia-driver-XXX` with the version that is appropriate for your system.
- **Permission Requirements:** Some parts of the script require `sudo` privileges, so you may be prompted to enter your password during execution.
